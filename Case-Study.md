## 📌 Project Overview

**AuthFlow** - A production-ready authentication & authorization API built to save developers time. Plug-and-play integration for any backend project requiring secure and scalable user authentication.

---

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives

The primary goal of **AuthFlow** is to eliminate the repetitive effort of building authentication systems from scratch. It offers a robust, reusable authentication and authorization API that developers can directly integrate into their projects, accelerating development and improving security consistency.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework:** NestJS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Queue Management:** BullMQ
- **Authentication:** PassportJS (JWT, Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth)
- **File Upload:** Multer
- **Storage:** AWS S3
- **CDN:** CloudFront
- **Mailing:** Nodemailer
- **Job Scheduler:** Node Cron
- **Docs:** Swagger

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Authentication via **JWT**, **Google OAuth**, and **GitHub OAuth**
- ✅ Secure user registration, login, logout, password reset, and password updates
- ✅ Token management using short-lived **access tokens (1h)** and **refresh tokens (7d)**
- ✅ **Email verification** flow with token-based links and resend capability
- ✅ **BullMQ integration** for background email processing to improve performance
- ✅ **Multer + AWS S3** for efficient and secure file uploads
- ✅ **CloudFront CDN** for fast image delivery across the globe
- ✅ **Node Cron** jobs for auto-cleanup of expired/unverified accounts
- ✅ **API rate limiting** to prevent brute-force and abuse
- ✅ **Swagger documentation** for easy API exploration and integration
- ✅ **Admin panel features** for managing users, roles, and tokens

## 🧱 Challenges Faced

1. **BullMQ Buffer Serialization Issue**
   Buffers were corrupted when sent to queues during file uploads.

2. **AWS S3 & CloudFront Configuration**
   Setting up proper access policies, signed URLs, and cache behavior.

3. **Session Management with Expired Tokens**
   Users could retain expired refresh tokens which posed security risks.

---

## 🧠 How I Overcame Them

1. Converted file `Buffer` data to base64 strings before enqueueing with BullMQ and decoded it back in the processor to preserve file integrity.

2. Studied AWS documentation and followed detailed YouTube tutorials to configure IAM roles, CORS, S3 bucket policies, and CloudFront distributions correctly.

3. Implemented a **scheduled cron job** that runs every hour to remove users with expired refresh tokens, maintaining a clean and secure session system.

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Learned how to handle file uploads and background job queues efficiently with **BullMQ** and **Multer**
- Gained deeper understanding of **OAuth strategies** and **JWT-based authentication**
- Mastered real-world **S3 + CloudFront** setup for media asset management
- Strengthened ability to manage **user lifecycle and session security**
- Experienced designing a production-ready API that emphasizes scalability, security, and maintainability

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)** support using TOTP
- [ ] Implement **device/session tracking and revocation**
- [ ] Add **webhook support** for external event integration
- [ ] Integrate **email template service** (like MJML or Resend)
- [ ] Create a **frontend admin panel** to visualize and manage data
- [ ] Package as a reusable **npm module** or **Docker container**

---

## ✅ Conclusion

**AuthFlow** is a plug-and-play authentication solution that abstracts the complexity of user management and security into a reusable, modular service. It’s production-tested, extensible, and saves significant development time—allowing you to focus on your core product features instead of reinventing auth logic every time.
